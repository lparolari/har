HAR is a very broad discipline full of pitfalls and problems
\cite{blunck2013heterogeneity}, \cite{chen2020deep},
\cite{stisen2015smart} and many techniques were proposed in literature
expoiting many types of features \cite{stisen2015smart},
\cite{ignatov2018real}, \cite{vincent2010stacked},
\cite{anguita2013public} and machine-learning models
\cite{ignatov2018real}, \cite{rao1964use}, \cite{gao2019human},
\cite{gadaleta2018idnet}.

In this paper we present a model based on \cite{ignatov2018real} where
they used Convolutional Neural Networks for local feature extraction
together with simple statistical features that preserve information
about the global form of time series. On the countrary, based on what
said in \cite{stisen2015smart} we show that statistical features are
not enough in real settings and many state-of-the-art models which
gets very high performances do not perform well when they are applied
on data gathered from non-controlled environemnt. For this reason, we
perform automatic feature extraction with an autoencoder based on
\cite{gao2019human}. We also adopt the Orientation Indipendent
Transformation described in \cite{gadaleta2018idnet}, in order to
become agnostic in terms of sensor biases and orientations.
