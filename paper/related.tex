HAR using smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data has been well studied in litterature. There are plenty of paper that try to tackle this problem using various machine learning or deep learning techniques. For example in \cite{frank2010reliable} authors proposed a set of handcrafted features combined with machine learning technique as SVMs, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees or Bayesian Techniques to perform the final classification. In \cite{anguita2013public} the authors that made the popular UCI dataset \cite{UCI}, achieved the best results using 561 hand-designed features and various classifier on top of them.  

Other state-of-the-art model uses automatic feature extraction methods to avoid manual-designed features. In \cite{ignatov2018real}, A. Ignativ uses a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) for local feature extraction together with simple
statistical features for preserving information about the global form
of time series. They also investigate the impact of time series length
on the recognition accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed approach is
evaluated on two commonly used datasets UCI \cite{UCI} and WISDM \cite{WISDM} datasets. The results show that the proposed model
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while requiring low
computational cost and no manual feature engineering.

However the work presented up to there as well as the majority of work available in litterature, test model performances in controlled envirorment acquired dataset as UCI and WISDM, without considering the HAR model impairments when they are used in real use case scenarios, like mobile apps. A. Stisen et al. in \cite{stisen2015smart} studied the technical details and
problems due to heterogeneity among users, sensors and
environemnt. They acquired a specific dataset that shows these etherogenities, and studied the impact onto models. Also they proposed various clustering and classification algorithms to perform HAR in these conditions.

In \cite{vaizman2018extrasensory}, authors acquired a huge in-the-wild dataset to promote pratical applications that work in real-life settings. They collected the so called Extransensory dataset \cite{EXTRASENSORY}, composed of over 300k minutes of sensor data with context labels from 60 subjects that uses their smartphones in any way that was convenient to them. They show how fusion multi-modal sensors is important for resolving the in-the-wild HAR problem.  However, they used more sensor signals like Magnetometer, Compass, GPS, Audio and Phone State in whoch we were not interested in. Furthermore we see that most of the collected data contains wrong context labels, because users most of the time aren't so precise in labeling datas, that could lower performance metrics of the proposed model.   

In this paper we start from the model proposed in \cite{ignatov2018real} and we show how the controlled
environemnt influences the classification. In particular, no
heterogeneity among devices (and sensors) leads to biased data and
not-natural settings.  For this reason we adopt the dataset provided
in \cite{stisen2015smart} which emphasizes devices heterogeneity.
We further investigate the
effectiveness of statistical/manual features which are usually not
enough in real settings, due to the heterogeneous scenario.
